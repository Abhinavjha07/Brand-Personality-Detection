            "b'SHC Speaks by With Father Day this Sunday, we asked our associates to share their favorite memories, a lesson or some words of wisdom passed down from their father. We received an overwhelming amount of replies from associates filled with love, gratitude and admiration for fathers and male role models. Below are a few responses that embody the spirit of Father Day . was a daddy girl for sure! My dad always told me, become like the people you surround yourself with, so surround yourself with good people. remembered that. dad and I have always been close. Great dads continue to watch out for you no matter how old you get. My dad worked for a railroad company located in the Union Station building in downtown Chicago. I remember that he walked me over to the Sears Tower to make sure that I didn get lost getting to my first day of work at Sears. Following that, I had the good fortune to ride the train down to work with him every day until he retired and we moved to Hoffman Estates, Illinois. I blessed to still have him around to enjoy this Father Day! dad worked for American Airlines for almost 40 years. He taught me the value of hard work, helped form my love of travel and commercial aviation, modeled treating everyone with courtesy and respect and provided love and stability. Anything good I pass along to my kids finds its origin in him. dad was always coming up with creative ways to surprise me and my sister. I remember one Christmas I really wanted a Power Wheel car. When I came downstairs Christmas morning and walked into the living room, I was dismayed not to find one waiting for me. My dad said, guess Santa couldn fit it into the house. He then walked over to the fireplace and pointed to the end of a piece of string taped there with a little note saying me. The string led into the kitchen and all the way down into the basement/garage where the other end was tied to a shiny red power wheel. Obviously, I didn know my dad was responsible at the time but I have come to appreciate this and many other fond memories of my dad. love to tell people about my dad, as he was probably the most influential person in my life. My dad was a hard-working carpenter until the day he died at 71. This August will mark 10 years since he passed. Today would have been his 81st birthday. My entire childhood, he fi our family cars rather than taking them to a mechanic (and used many of Craftsman tools when doing so). He was also one who could easily say love you to his children, perhaps because he grew up without hearing those words from his own father. The ways in which he told us he loved us were numerous. When I left home to venture out on my own, it took on the form of asking me how my car was running. Every time I called him, even if it was on Father Day or his birthday (which was supposed to be all about him), one of the first things he would ask me is is your car running? What I heard each time he asked was, love you. dad enlisted in the Army Air Corp at the beginning of WWII. He was in WWII, the Korean War and Vietnam.

Our pharmacists are valued members of their communities, giving customers and members convenient access to a health and wellness e almost anytime they need one. The average Kmart pharmacist has been with us almost 12 years, translating into strong community relationships and improved patient care. We offer a variety of resources to help on either side of the equation, including regular and ongoing access to our pharmacists. Earlier this year, we launched the Kmart Pharmacy mobile app that enables our members to access to the . In May, we announced that we started working with Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy, an industry leader in patient care, to give our customers and Shop Your Way members access to , bringing specialized support for a variety of diseases and conditions, including: HIV, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Hepatitis C, among others. By 2018, specialty medications are projected to account for more than 51 percent of sales within the top 100 prescription products. Through this new agreement with Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy, we now offer a new level of service and convenience to meet the growing needs of the specialty medication population. We now also offer , for any online prescription orders made through the . We just launched the service where members are able to post a question and get a response within 24 hours from a licensed Kmart pharmacist in their state. This service goes beyond what many key competitors are doing with general Q&A without member-specific support. Several months ago we took steps to narrow our focuses and begin a journey to implement back-to-basics best practices to be better positioned for profitable growth. To that end, was created, a program with specific goals and lead measures, which keeps reminding us to focus on the most important component to retail pharmacy success, our patients. We started with engaging physicians within our communities, making personal visits to their offices to discuss and introduce our services. We are making personal calls to our members to make sure they don forget to pick up their prescriptions and making sure all our chronic medication patients are enrolled in our auto-fill program so their prescriptions are ready on time. As part of the program, we are focused on Medication Therapy Management, which is another way for us to optimize drug therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes for our patients. We also heavily invest in acquiring new patients with in-store conversion opportunities as well as through more integrated and targeted initiatives to offer our products and services. Going back to the basics means that we are going the e mile of asking every member if they are up-to-date on all immunizations. This year we are aiming to meet the needs of all of our patients by offering multiple , including Zostavax, Pneumovax, Tdap/Td, Hepatitis A & B, HPV and MMR. In addition, we are looking to add travel vaccinations to our Kmart stores in geographic areas that need this service.

            "b'SHC Speaks by As a 128 year old company, Sears has been a part of American life for generations. With the Sears Catalog, it was the nation pioneer in providing what we call today an integrated marketplace for everything from automobiles to fine china. But the retail landscape has changed significantly over the past decade. We are proud of our legacy but we also recognize the need to adapt, innovate and transform . Like many other things that have been impacted by emerging and mobile technologies, customers shopping behavior has dramatically changed in the past few years as well. Customers are more informed than ever. Access to product information is easy, comparing prices across retailers is a few clicks away and, researching products and using that knowledge to influence their purchases has become the norm. Mobile phones have made it even easier to get access to this information at the point of purchase. We saw this shift early on and understood how these changes could impact a traditional business model. That why we have been so focused on Integrated Retail, which means leveraging our strengths our associates, physical stores, online and mobile capabilities, the Shop Your Way membership program, and a robust supply chain to provide our members with the ease of shopping online and the physical aspect of shopping in store. Retail is a competitive business, impacted even more so by online-only retailers that don have fi costs like traditional brick and mortar retailers do. They also have lot more fle with technology investments that enable them to e a very dynamic business model without the constraints and challenges of legacy systems. We don think in terms of store investments versus online investments because in many ways one complements the other. Rather, investing in online allows us to bring those digital capabilities into our stores, and investing in our stores makes inventory and fulfillment options available to our members online. Our online and mobile investments are part of the shopping eco-system, with Shop Your Way at the core of the transformation. Transforming Sears Holdings from a company focused on running stores and selling products to a company focused on serving members across any channel (stores, online, mobile) is not easy and it doesn happen overnight. It a journey. It also a challenge that many of us at Sears Holdings have taken upon ourselves and are e to tackle. I am fortunate to work every day with a talented team that is creative, passionate and determined to figure out ways to provide our members with the best possible integrated retail e in our stores. We have built or enhanced capabilities such as: We have lot more work to do but we are encouraged to see the growth in areas where we are investing. I look forward to sharing more with you as we build these capabilities. Our focus has been, and continues to be on what matters the most innovating around our members and our customers. '\n",

Effectively managing and improving the operating performance of our apparel business is one of Sears Holdings top priorities in 2016, as our Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert recently .

Specifically, we are dedicated to having the right product assortment for our members, the right sourcing strategy and a deep, e set of leaders in place to positively impact this business. Our members and customers tastes change quickly and we need to better match their shopping behaviors and interest in fresh assortment by focusing on several key brands from Kmart and Sears. As part of this shift, will continue to reduce the number of overall brands and product categories while working to elevate the product. We are proud of our members response to the new styles of various brands, such as: It vital that we offer our members and customers the right fashion at the right time at the right price. We will continue to become less reliant on partner brands, and more focused on getting stylish apparel to our members and customers through greater control over our supply chain. By leveraging better sourcing and a direct business approach, we anticipate that that the resulting cost improvements will have a direct result on margins and the price that the member pays. We have a strong leadership team in place to support the apparel business transformation. These are leaders with significant merchandising, design, sourcing and operational e at companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Hollister Co., Inditex, New Look, Primark and Victoria Secret.

The recognizes United States citizens who have achieved the required number of hours of service over a 12-month time period or cumulative hours over the course of a lifetime. The Lifetime Achievement award is for those who contribute more than 4,000 hours of service in their lifetime. Along with the ultimate honor of presidential recognition, recipients receive a personalized certificate, an official pin, medallion or coin a letter from the president of the United States. I currently manage two stores in Dayton, Ohio and have been working for Kmart for the past three years. I have been volunteering as far back as I can remember starting at school as a child. Whether it was in the library, during breaks or tutoring as requested, participating in school fundraisers and festivals annually, I was always involved. As I got older, I also participated in our community program, Cincinnati Beautiful. Currently, I am a member of the (MRC) and my time with them has contributed to accredited volunteer hours. The a national network of volunteers, who are organized locally to improve the health and safety of their communities. The network comprises nearly 1,000 community-based units and over 200,000 volunteers located throughout the United States and its territories. MRC include medical and public health professionals, as well as other community members without healthcare backgrounds. The units engage volunteers to strengthen public health, improve emergency response capabilities and build community resiliency. prepare for and respond to natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and floods, as well as other emergencies affecting public health, such as disease outbreaks. I also created and facilitate a public community program called dedicated to supporting from all around the world in their fight against cancer. My is to assist in the fight for a cure by raising awareness through the stories of survivors, fighters or those who have lost their battle to cancer while offering support to cancer patients and their families. I take great pride in recognizing and rewarding their milestones such as; recognizing them as official heroes in the cancer community; celebrating birthdays; recognizing the number of survival years since being diagnosed; or an anniversary of being cancer free. I often hear people say they wish they had the time or energy to help. But just as you do as a parent (proud mother of four), you make time and you put forth the energy. The reward you receive by helping others is much larger than money, a certificate or any other award. Seeing a smile from someone you helped, receiving a thank you, or a hug/handshake is in my opinion the highest level of achievement anyone can strive for, and that is why I do what I do. I want to be a better me, and giving back is my way of achieving that goal. I challenge you to make time to volunteer an hour each month. It will really inspire and humble you as it has for me. I encourage you all to to be inspired. '\n",

Consumers are now time poor and information rich and retailers have to bow down to them, fulfilling their every need before they venture elsewhere.;Todays consumers not only have more power, but they also shop differently. They read reviews and compare prices online. They want to see merchandise on the shelves of your store, as well as the ability to order now and collect in store, and the ability to order now and get their goods delivered home. They e to find what theyre looking for, whatever theyre looking for and if they dont, they will go elsewhere. Meeting this demand for convenience is crucial to your business success, but it brings about challenges, too.;One of these challenges is understanding current-day supply and demand. In a 2013 Pierhouse survey of 250 consumers, 91% (the number one reason) admitted that they would leave a store if they couldnt find what they were looking for. Although bricks and mortar stores worry that e-retailers and showrooming where customers try things on in store and then buy online will take over, the truth is that there are customers out there, in physical stores, with their wallet open and have time to spend buying what they really want. Simply adapting, meeting and e the needs of consumers will ensure that they stay in store.;Another challenge is the monitoring of customer behaviour. With needs and demands constantly changing, e need to be acknowledged and predicted in a timely manner. For e, when retailers launched their Click & Collect service and located it within the store, it failed because consumers didnt want to go into the store to just pick up shopping. Now, retailers have listened to the consumers by bringing the click and collect service to the car park convenience.;Take the French supermarket chain, Leclerc, for e. It has more than 65 drive-through stores, enabling shoppers to order online 24/7 and collect 12 hours a day at a designated time by simply driving up to the kiosk and confirming their order. Staff will even place items directly into the boot of the car.;Companies like Leclerc are succeeding in todays marketplace, because they offer an unrivalled level of convenience to their customers. Theyre also prepared for customer demand, and are able to provide the products they say they will, when they say they will.;With RFID technology, combined with local knowledge and demographics forecasting, (for e, if theres a baby boom in your city, there will be a higher demand for nappies in a retirement hotspot, there wont), youll have greater visibility of stock youll need. Youll be able to create the ultimate smart inventory for stock in store and online, as well as click and collect purchases all in one place.;Adapting to the new customer DNA and having the product available will be one more reason for the consumer to stay in your store.;What are the difficulties that you face when bowing down to your customers? ; to find out how we could help you solve them, or you could visit our ; to see how Zebra has the perfect solution for you.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '\n",

A frictionless shopping e is simple, works without difficulty, and prioritises ease of use above all else.;This concept of hassle-free shopping certainly appeals to me! I know there have been many instances where Ive been unable to pick up my favourite brands, despite going out of my way to collect them. That moment you reach the aisle, look up and find an ominous gap where your favourite coffee should be is particularly disheartening. The opportunity to avoid such incessant disappointment is most welcome!;As we move into the future, theres no doubt retailers will look to offer a frictionless shopping e of their own, and further simplify the way we buy in-store. After all, they have to do something to compete with the digital alternatives available at our fingertips 24/7. In fact, Tesco has already started on their journey to offering a frictionless shopping e with their If This Then That campaign. Allowing customers to connect platforms and create action based triggers, Tesco are providing the tools necessary to enable a fully customisable frictionless shopping e. Customers with the right know-how can now set up their own algorithms to ensure products are automatically ordered when certain circumstances are met. While this is perhaps a little complicated for the average shopper right now, its a sign of positive intent from the UKs largest grocery retailer.;Its really no surprise retailers are looking to achieve a frictionless shopping e. With common inconveniences removed, the act of buying will be simplified even further and this intern should drive repeat custom. By taking out unnecessary processes, and automating those that cannot be removed, the retail e is set to deliver greater efficiency and value than ever before. Through the adoption of a smart infrastructure that actively monitors and manages resources, retailers will achieve a whole new level of performance. For e, new checkouts will be opened automatically based on the length of queues waiting and stock will be instantly replenished as and when it runs out on the shop floor.

Although wireless wide area networks such as 3G or 4G are now available in most urban areas, Wi-Fi is still preferred in most cases due to wide support of all sort of devices and the fact that you can get free connection now in most public places, including bars/restaurants, airports, hotels, city centers, stadium etc. More importantly, most people now enjoy Wi-Fi at home and e the same e when they travel, leisure, work etc. It's fair to say that Wi-Fi has grown from being a niche technology used by companies in warehouses and other business environments to a commodity technology (available to almost everyone). ; So if Wi-Fi has now become commodity, does this mean that the same Wi-Fi technology that we use at home can be used in business environments as well? Not e. Even though we have standards for Wi-Fi products, which guarantee that an Access Point from vendor X works with a tablet from vendor Y, there are some important differences between products that are designed for personal use (or SOHO, Small Office / Home Office) and Enterprise Class solutions. While most people can imagine that a Wi-Fi network in a large hospital, university or retailer with hundreds of stores will have other requirements than the Wi-Fi you have at home, the differences may be less obvious for a Small or Medium Business (SMB). Especially when looking at the price of your little home router or AP, it may look attractive to buy the same products for your business. After all, it works at home, so why wouldn't it work at the office. Good question. Well, the answer is that at work (regardless the size of your business) you probably need an Enterprise Class solution. So then tell me what 'Enterprise Class' means, I hear you think. Basically it means that the solution is 'fit' for use in a professional business environment which then means it has specific features and options which supports your business better than a home or SOHO product.

The best of these programmes deliver personalised rewards, but many still focus on impersonal loyalty points awarded based on amount spent.;Even though technology and data have made it easier to create a loyalty programme, it seems harder than ever to generate loyalty. The key point is that loyalty is driven by much more than offers and discounts. Its about delivering the perfect e for the customer and what customers want is convenience. So retailers need to make the shoppers e appropriate, and that often means simple and quick.;Advanced, invisible analytics whether predictive, real time or historical, have the power to help retailers deliver a more connected, personalised e that meets the needs of the modern shopper. And 2015 is set to be the year where the use of data and analytics in retail becomes more prolific. But for retailers to grasp the opportunity it often requires internal process changes and of course the inevitable technology investment.;Done correctly, that investment has serious potential for return.;But where is the right place to start? Well, as with all the best elements of retail, it has to start with the customer:;Guest Wi-Fi is the starting point, helping connect customers to key store data, allowing them to find the information they need to make an informed decision:;Understandably, many retailers hesitate to make it easier for customers to compare prices, the ; even allows shoppers to take a photo of an item in store and see similar products available via Amazon. But, retailers cant fight this trend. If customers cant access the information they need to feel comfortable with a purchase theyll often walk away.;For this reason, we are seeing an upsurge in retailers adopting in-store customer shopping apps incorporating information, store maps and offers. Built on the Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth technology, indoor location technology and mobile store maps help shoppers to find items quickly.;But theres another benefit for retailers, and that is the ability to collect data and map individual in-store journeys. This allows retailers to see something new what the customer looked at, but didnt buy. True customer level insight into every journey where customers opt-in.;Through this retailers can start to develop bespoke promotions to individuals based on who they are, what they are interested in, their location in store and more importantly, at the point of decision. It also gives retailers a view of behavioural trends and the chance to respond through the flow of the store.;These location-based technologies help shoppers find the right product and give retailers the insight to continually improve the customer e.;And making the customers journey easier, is the key to creating the e interactions and customer engagement required to build a relationship.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '\n",
            "b' ; December 8, 2015 at 8:00 AM ;As manufacturers deliver ongoing customer value through smart products, new service-centric business models have taken over. The emergence of smart, connected products through the;is shifting the OEM business model from one based on selling individual products to one that sells systems of connected products, sensors, data, and services.;To learn how the IoT is impacting the manufacturing industry, I spoke with Jim Hilton, Director of Global Solutions Marketing at Zebra Technologies.;is a global solutions and services company focused on making businesses as smart and connected as the world we live in and making the IoT the transformative technological initiative of the decade. Hilton is in charge of manufacturing, transportation, and logistics solutions, which, for Zebra, is all about tracking the visibility of goods, assets, people, processes, and places.;Zebras products provide visibility from inception so end users and service organizations can see how efficiently an asset is functioning and set parameters to alert them when its performing below a specified level.;It used to be that maintenance for an asset was reactive, said Hilton. The machine malfunctioned on a production line, therefore the red light went off because someone pressed a button and the engineer came running with a screwdriver. Preventive maintenance used to be a technician walked up with an index card and checked off the vitals of that asset.;That process has evolved and revolutionized to the point that now you have an enterprise grade ability to do predictive maintenance. In other words, the sensor in the asset essentially tells the maintenance department: you should take a look at this because the vitals are not looking the way theyre supposed to. And, by the way, if you ignore it, in about 3 weeks, the machine is going to stop working completely.;This sort of insight into equipment health and performance is what;. And as Hilton emphasized, theres nothing worse for a production floor than unplanned downtime.;One of the biggest challenges of having access to smart, connected equipment and the;it provides is making sense of all the information coming from machines.; With the ability not only to collect machine intelligence, but also make sense of it, service organizations will be able to offer customers advanced service packages that end users may not have even known were available. The best part every decision is backed by concrete data so manufacturers arent wasting time focusing on areas that dont work or trying to sell service contracts customers dont need.; Hilton says that manufacturers have been capturing data since the 80s but it was so difficult to get that many businesses didnt do anything with it. The emergence of the cloud and the IoT type products built into machines today make collecting and analyzing data easier and less e.; Because of the cloud and smart, connected products, data can be handed up without the ball and chain of a network. IoT has taken what was just simple automation and made it actionable. Through the cloud, with systems to store and display data, anyone around the world can see that data while theres still time to do something with it.; You need both: the ability to capture and interpret data. For e, Hilton said, if theres a two week delay for service businesses to see insights from data, what good is that? There needs to be instant access, which is where a;is key. It allows you to see critical data at a time when you can still do something with the information.; '\n",
            "b' ; April 21, 2016 at 3:30 AM ;The in-store interaction is an integral part of the entire shopper e. Almost two thirds (60.1%) of shoppers are willing to buy more merchandise from a retailer that they believe provides better customer service. So its vital that retailers get it right, especially when you consider that consumers are using smart phones to gain information on products and pricing before, during and after the in-store visit.;Zebras recent European Shopper Survey revealed that customers want a mobile in-store e. 42.1% of respondents said they have a better e when staff use the latest technology to assist them. In particular, customers felt their e is improved when mobile computers are used by staff to check stock availability (55.6%) and to take payments anywhere in store (46.5%) a view I share.;Given the significance of getting the in-store e right, retailers should be looking at how they can deploy this technology. Especially since, as the way we shop continues to evolve, the use of mobile devices will eventually be considered the norm and instead retailers will be e to invest in beacon technology, automated sales processes and personalised displays.;Mobile technology has led to a huge shift in the way we shop. As online retailers are typically perceived to offer products at a lower price compared to their brick and mortar counterparts, the practice of showrooming is becoming increasingly popular and mobile devices only make the process easier. Retailers therefore need to look at ways in which they can embrace this new method of shopping.;I am pleased to see that retailers are beginning to capitalise on the phenomenon of reverse showrooming; by perfecting the integration between offline and digital channels, retailers are beating e-commerce competitors on convenience. Knowledgeable sales staff, in-store pick-up and smartphone discounts are all being used to bring and keep showroomers in-store. However, I would like to see more retailers offering customers real-time marketing offers while they are in-store looking at products to give customers a reason not to purchase online.;We as customers are inundated with communications from brands and with their being little incentive for us to remain loyal, retailers need to find new ways to use loyalty schemes to build strong customer relationships. App-based loyalty schemes enable real-time, location based offers so that brands can stop bombarding their customers and instead provide us with offers and incentives when we actually want them. The same app can also deliver a whole array of other services to customers such as product location, origin and even in some cases such as Starbucks act as stored value for easy payment.;Loyalty programmes offer retailers an e opportunity to gain in-depth customer insights that can be used to personalise the e, build better customer relationships and discourage showrooming. However, our survey revealed that only 38.9% of shoppers have downloaded a shopping-related app and just 9.7% use a smartphone loyalty scheme. Retailers need to target this large potential customer group to download their apps to ensure they can capitalise on loyalty schemes moving forwards.;All in all, mobile technology is already playing a key role in the development of retail and will only become more integral both to the sector and the way we as consumers wish to shop in the future. As sales processes are automated mobile devices will become essential, the threat of showrooming will have to be reversed through the use of mobile technology and customer loyalty will need to be far more timely and location based as it too becomes mobile.;To read the ; and learn more about why mobile technology was one of the key trends of 2015, click the button below:; Topics: ;, ;, ; '\n",
            "b' ; November 7, 2014 at 8:17 AM ;With ;, businesses are looking for new ways to deliver a personalized brand e to their customers. From retail shoppers, to guests at a resort to families driving up to their favorite quick serve restaurant, businesses want to engage their customers through their personal mobile devices.;Rather than one-size-fits-all offers, todays businesses want to provide personalized engagements designed to target a customers specific preferences, for e: coupons, specials, or ordering a meal via their device and skipping the line at a quick serve restaurant. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction and address the life style needs of todays connected consumer.;Before I discuss iOS 8, I will cover how Wi-Fi is used in these engagement applications and the importance of the MAC address on the mobile device.;Businesses use Wi-Fi to identify and communicate with a customer through their mobile device while they are in and around the business location. If Wi-Fi is enabled, a mobile device will search for a Wi-Fi access point to connect to. During this process, the mobile device transmits its unique MAC address via a Probe Request. If the customer has the brand app on their device and is registered to automatically connect to the business Wi-Fi, their device will automatically connect. An analytics platform like MPact will identify the customer, enabling the business to deliver a welcome message or a customized offer.;If the registered customer has chosen not to automatically connect to the Wi-Fi, but Wi-Fi is enabled, the analytics platform can still associate the device MAC address to the customer. In this scenario, a message may be sent through the app via LTE unless the customer has opted out of push notifications.;In the case of unregistered mobile customers with no app installed, customers that have their Wi-Fi enabled will broadcast their MAC addresses via the Probe Requests. Though the analytics platform will not know who they are, the business will be able to determine if the user is outside or inside a location, record and monitor their MAC address for frequent visits, determine at which locations they shop, as well as the number of mobile customers at each location. These analytics help the business determine the potential to connect with new connected consumers and design new incentives to attract more mobile users to download their app and become a member.;In each of these scenarios, the MAC address provides an important element of associating a device to a user. With this in mind, the latest release of Apples iOS 8 noted that it would be using a random MAC address, creating a pseudo address under certain conditions on Apple mobile devices. The use of random MAC addresses could potentially affect analytics, especially if one device could broadcast many different MAC addresses, virtually looking like many different devices. We tested a number of Apple devices with iOS 8 to characterize how they behave and the impact, if any, this has on analytics and location;As a result of our testing, we discovered that only the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S with iOS 8 have this feature and we determined that there is minimal impact on MPact analytics and locationing. The iPhones only transmitted the random MAC when the phone entered sleep mode and the location based services and cellular data services are turned off. However, if a phone does transmit random MAC addresses, these can be filtered out in analytics since these pseudo MAC addresses do not have a valid vendor prefix.;When it comes to location tracking, the users device must be connected to the Wi-Fi and once the device is associated and connected to the Wi-Fi, it will always provide its unique MAC address.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '\n",

I would have thought we all want to be respected as individuals by the retailers we buy from. For me, that's the bottom line of personalisation: treating people like people.;It's one of the cornerstones of any loyalty strategy. The more retailers can understand their customers, the better the service they can provide, and the more willing customers will be to buy regularly.;Coincidentally, Zebra's own research (EMEA Shoppers Survey, 2015) shows that 79% of customers the same 79%? are happy to share at least some personal data with retailers.;As consumers, we're becoming more marketing-savvy. We understand that if we give information to retailers about our tastes and preferences, we're more likely to be offered choices that are relevant and valuable.;The danger is that personalisation turns into intrusion. Building a loyalty strategy is a masterclass in tightrope walking. How can you let customers know you care?;It's about balancing attentive, personalised service against the risk of becoming a pestering nuisance.;Zebra is working with a number of retailers on the ways they gather data from digital sources. They're using Zebra in-store wireless, card printers and scanners to learn as much as they can about their customers' tastes, preferences and shopping habits.;RFID solutions from Zebra also feed into the data pool, giving real-time information about which items are moving off the shelves faster. RFID data can also show patterns of sale, such as the time of day when certain lines sell more than others, or the effect of a special offer on sales volumes.;This wealth of information can feed directly into an analytics ecosystem that can interpret the data in infinite variations. In the process, the patterns and profiles emerge that enable retailers to walk the tightrope of loyalty and personalisation with surefooted success.;As a consumer, I have my favourite retailers, but I don't want them to behave like needy friends. You know the kind; they always seem to call at the most inconvenient time, or persuade you to borrow DVDs you have no intention of watching.;What I want is a trusted advisor there when I need them, and perhaps occasionally inviting me to try something new. Their timing will always be perfect, and the new things they offer will be based on a genuine understanding of what I like.;The Zebra One Store solution enables this kind of personalised e. The name One Store was conceived to flip the idea of 'omnichannel retail' round and view the shopping e from the consumer's perspective.;One Store allows retailers to capture data from multiple channels and gain a full understanding of how each individual customer interacts with them.;I envisage a scenario in which I download an app that makes it easier to browse a retailer's online store and see the products I want. I can also use it to check that stock is available at my local branch.;When I arrive, I connect to the guest Wi-Fi and the app guides me through the shop to the items I'm looking for.;Then, as I pass down a particular aisle, I get a message offering a price reduction on the lines I'm about to see products that may not have been on my list for the day, but are certainly relevant and interesting, based on my past purchases and browsing habits.;Perhaps the ultimate personalised e would be for a member of staff to be there in the aisle and welcome me by name, inviting me to take up the offer. It would have to be handled with care, but a good retail sales specialist should be well-practised at putting people at their ease.;It's the ideal balance of digital services with the classic retail e.;And it's the great paradox of technology. Amid all the concerns about the digital barriers between us, it's actually allowing us to be more human, with sensitive personalised shopping e that engender lasting loyalty.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ; \"\n",

These included the use of more apps, the need for employees to access Wi-Fi in its car parks and the requirements of customers who wanted to surf the web or catch up on emails while waiting for their cars.;Taking the decision to install a new ; network across its self-service shops and workshops, Norauto approached Zebra partner Norcod, (part of the Digital Dimension Group), to update its networks.;Norcod configured and installed Zebra wireless infrastructure across 260 Norauto centres in France, with a mix of indoor and outdoor access points providing coverage across car parks, workshops, stores and back offices. Norcod also uses Zebra technology to remotely monitor and maintain the networks to ensure they run smoothly.;The fast, reliable networks are being used by employees and guests. Employees access a range of apps through their Zebra MC65 mobile computers, including inventory look-ups and vehicle checks.

The point is, its another e of technology making giant leaps forward, and forcing businesses to think about how they respond.;In this case, its likely that millions of businesses will be thinking seriously about making a change to their wireless networks. Because any wireless network thats more than three years old is probably not up to the job of meeting todays demand for connectivity.;Just think back five years. We had the launch of the first iPad while still awestruck by the iPhone 3GS, neither of which are much use today as serious business tools. And the latest Wi-Fi network standard was 802.11n, with connection speeds of up to 600 megabits per second.;By 2011, IDC Research was telling us that more devices were being shipped without an Ethernet port than with one. And Deloitte reported that 425 million tablets and smartphones were sold, as opposed to 390 million desktops, laptops and netbooks.;Today, ABI Research estimates that there are close to 8 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices competing for connection to the worlds wireless networks. The 802.11ac standard, introduced in 2013, delivers up to 1.2 gigabits per second twice the speed available just two years earlier.;Its certainly commonplace now for office workers to bring a smartphone, a tablet and a laptop to work and maybe even a Wi-Fi-hungry watch.;And, unlike in years past, those workers are not only surfing the web and using email, they are regularly video conferencing and working with other types of data-demanding applications. Mobility and security have become critical issues, especially for organisations that allow people to connect their own devices to their Wi-Fi network.;So if you and your team are getting frustrated with slow-responding business applications, or failed phone or video calls, its likely that the devices and applications youre using are asking more from your network than it can handle. Its time to upgrade, or go for a complete replacement.;But, as always with technology, new doesnt always mean best. And very often, if youre worried about picking the right wireless solution for the future, its worth partnering with a provider that understands the past, and why the technology is evolving in the way that it is.;Wireless in particular has a venerable heritage. Wi-Fi essentially uses the same principles Edison and Marconi were tinkering with in the earliest days of radio.;A deep understanding of the principles of radio is needed to ensure that the signal is delivered efficiently and at peak performance, wherever people need it.;The Wi-Fi standard itself IEEE 802.11 was actually established in 1999.

In September 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration released its final ruling on legislation requiring all medical devices distributed in the United States to carry a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) label. The regulation covers all products classified as medical devices, including Class I, II, and III devices, InVitro devices, software, and some tissue-based products.;The UDI law will be implemented over the course of several years, beginning with Class III devices, which must be fully compliant by September 24, 2014. The FDA has provided a schedule that details the mandatory compliance deadlines for different types of products. Any company that is not compliant by the required date will be prohibited from selling or distributing covered products in the United States.;We posed the following questions to David Coons, vice president, Advanced Markets and Technology at Zebra.;A: Class III medical devices and human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P) regulated as a device must be labeled with a UDI by September 24, 2014.;A: The UDI is comprised of a Device Identifier (DI) and a Production Identifier (PI). These two identifiers can be separate or integrated together, but they both must be present.;The DI is a fi numeric or alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the labeler and the specific version or model of a device. The PI holds variable production control data such as lot number, serial number, manufacturing date, and/or e date of a device identified by the DI.;A: Maybe, but probably not. Compliance involves the printing of a properly formatted label with a Device ID andProduct ID in both human and machine readable formats. The UDI is NOT a code that is self-generated or inventedby your company. The code must be approved by the FDA and issued by one of three companies that havereceived special FDA accreditation.In addition, the Device ID must be registered in the FDAs Global Unique Device Identifier Database (GUDID)before it may be used on a UDI label. Unless your company has satisfied all the requirements, you are not UDIcompliant.;A: To date there are three independent entities that FDA has accredited to develop and issue UDIs to the medicaldevice industry.;A: Yes, every product in a covered product category must have its own DI. In fact each packing level (each carton,case, etc.) will need its own DI. Remember that the law even covers software that is classified as a medicaldevice. This means that companies may have hundreds or thousands of codes to obtain and manage.;A: The FDA GUDID database currently requires appro 60 data fields to be provided for every DI. Thesedata fields include device descriptions, company information, packaging information, storage and handlingconditions, sterilization information, etc. The FDA may modify or add to these required attributes periodically.;A: There are two possible ways to upload and manage your companys data in the GUDID.;Stay tuned for Part 2 of the Q&A on Thursday!;For more information, visit;or contact:;Mark Borah;Zebra Technologies;Business Development Manager;mborah@zebra.com;800-423-0442;To download the PDF version ofUDI Labeling Requirements for Medical Devices: Part 1, click the download button below.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '\n",

With a total of 9.6 million video views to-date on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter it is our new record as the No. 1 most viewed video in Xerox history 3 times our prior video view record. won Best B2B Integrated Ad Campaign in the 2017 Internet Advertising Competition (IAC) Awards. Among the metrics: A lift in brand ad recall of 53.4 percent, which is a best-in-class Google benchmark. Brother Dominic sets the page free and helps @Xerox snag two awards. These awards recognize the power of the Brother Dominic film, and the relevance of the messages it delivers about how Xerox is the way the world communicates, connects and works, as well as the momentum and impact delivered by an integrated campaign. I tempted to say this is a miraculous outcome. In fact, it the result of hard work and inspiration from the Xerox Advertising & Media team and our agency partners Y&R, VML and MEC. Their creative ingenuity brought back Brother Dominic after a 40-year hiatus to demonstrate the power and relevance of Xerox. The idea behind setting the page free is not new. It what Xerox has been doing since we introduced the first copier, which automated the task of duplication and freed operators from a slow and laborious process. But don let our history limit your imagination. The page is more than paper. Setting the page free transcends both the physical and digital, liberates the way we use and share information, and enables each of us to be more productive. The phrase nods to our heritage, reflects our present and embraces our future. In order to be free, some pages may need to: Our breakthrough technologies including digital printing, printed electronics, intelligent packaging and direct-to-object print are already solving many of these challenges. Brother Dominic has come a long way in 40 years. The original Brother Dominic needed to make 500 copies of his manuscript. The new Brother Dominic must do that plus translate it into 35 languages, personalize each one, and then share with colleagues around the world on paper, smartphones and even a coffee mug. It would take a miracle for one person to get it all done. Lucky for Brother Dominic, that what we do here at Xerox: Set the page free, enabling our customers to perform their own miracles every day. The Global ACE Awards is the longest running B-to-B award program and recognizes the year top creative campaigns, the inspired talent who conceived them, and the agencies and clients who have successfully elevated brand and driven demand. The New York Times has hailed the awards as of the industry best creative awards. (Last year winners were GE & IBM so we are in good company.) The IAC Awards are the first and only industry-based advertising award competition dedicated e to online digital advertising. These awards recognize outstanding online advertising in varying forms including online ads, video, mobile, newsletter, email and social media, and includes both the creative, as well as paid media activation. As Dominic needs have evolved over the past forty years, so has Xerox ability to continually delight with relevant products and solutions. ad campaign does an amazing job of seamlessly integrating a hoary past with the technology advancements of the present and the future! me with suspenseful anticipation about what Brother Dominic and Xerox would be doing forty years from now! That is an e vision Deepak for Brother Dominic and Xerox!'\n",

            "b'.;30-JAN-2017;The A350-900 is the Lufthansa fleets state-of-the-art newcomer. This aircraft is considered the most advanced and most environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft in the world. The possibilities offered by the on-board entertainment system on the A350-900 are likewise leading edge. For the first time, passengers will have the option of making a selection from the on-board program from home before setting off and adding their favorite items to a playlist.;To do this, all passengers need to do is load the \"Lufthansa Companion App\" onto their own tablet or mobile phone. The on-board program is available up to six weeks in advance. Once on board, passengers then synchronize their personal favorite playlist with the screen in front of the seat, and there is also the option to use the own mobile device as a second screen. During the flight, passengers can then choose something to watch from their favorites list, and at the same time call up flight information, go on social media websites via FlyNet, do a little online shopping in the WorldShop, or find out a few things about the destination they are heading for. The app is available now and can be downloaded from Google Play Store - find it by entering \"Lufthansa Companion App\" in the search field. The app will also soon be available in the Apple iTunes Store.;Lufthansa\\'s entertainment program alone will be enough to stop passengers from getting bored. There is currently a choice of 100 movies, 200 TV programs, an e audio program with lots of CDs, playlists and audio books, games to play, and a children\\'s section with lots of different films and music to choose from, plus information from the world of Lufthansa. Current news and sports reports from live TV channels can also be accessed via the seat screen or via the free FlyNet portal.;The flight information on offer also gives passengers an opportunity to try out a digital travel e in 3D. New interactive options make it possible to see the flight route in advance and to call up various different flight views.;The A350-900 also offers further improvements to comfort and convenience with larger screens for passengers in all classes. The user interface in the latest design provides passengers with a choice of ten different languages.;Lufthansa will be stationing the first ten Airbus A350-900 aircraft in Munich as of February 2017. The first destinations served will be Delhi and Boston. The aircraft can carry 293 passengers - 48 in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class. The A350-900 is currently the world\\'s most advanced and most environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft.

On flight LH762 on 14 February, the youngest member of the fleet also had a special surprise on board: a donation cheque from help alliance for over 30,000 euros for the Sunshine\" education project in Delhi. With this, the Lufthansa Groups charitable organisation has increased its commitment for the project in 2017 by half again.;More than 250 girls and boys from the Saidulajab slum in the Indian capital Delhi are currently being given the chance to attain a qualification equivalent of a high school diploma by the Sunshine Project, something which would in normal circumstances not have been possible. With this, they increase their chances on the job market. For most of the children, the Sunshine Project is a new home away from the at times catastrophic conditions in the slum; here, they receive regular meals and medical care.;The cheque was handed over by help alliance patron Vivian Spohr to Kuku Arora who launched the Sunshine Project in 2002 with his wife Priti. Thanks to the generous donation from help alliance, we have the security in place for long-term planning and can now help even more children and young people to get their school-leaving qualifications, said the trained tailor as he was given the donation. help alliance has supported the project since 2009.;Kuku and Priti Arora have performed e work for many years in helping children and young people to find their way out of poverty. Thanks to the intensive support and the resulting positive development, the parents are also increasingly motivated to escape the vicious cycle of poverty. We are pleased that through this financial reinforcement, we can now offer even more children prospects for the future, said patron Vivian Spohr.;help alliance has been closely connected with the people of India since its foundation in 1999. The charitable organisation currently supports five projects on the subcontinent. Over the past ten years it has invested around 2.5 million euros in donations in the Indian education project. This is almost 20 percent of all donations.;Deutsche Lufthansa AG;Media Relations;The Lufthansa Group assumes responsibility through its own business for current social challenges as an internationally active Group and part of the German and international community. This is achieved using its non-profit organisation help alliance. Closer to the world. Closer to its people. This is the guiding principle of socially engaged employees of the Lufthansa Group. There are around forty support initiatives all over the world bundled together under the umbrella of help alliance, which in particular are there to give young people access to education and to enable them to lead the lives they want to live. The projects are funded solely by donations. For each project, employees of the Lufthansa Group voluntarily take responsibility in cooperation with competent local partners, who have many years of e in development co-operation. help alliance can trust in the strength of the Lufthansa Group in their work: Be it the e or the global commitment and network of around 120,000 employees.

            "b'.;04-AUG-2017;There is no doubt that digitalization has changed the way we live. By now, it has also permeated almost every aspect of aviation. And this is why we here at the Lufthansa Group are using digitalization to make our business even better and more efficient. For the Lufthansa Group, 2017 is dedicated to this theme. On January 10th, at the Digital Aviation Forum in Frankfurt, we presented the digital portfolio of our group to decision makers, the media, and our customers.;Digitalization can result in major increases in efficiency. Chatbots digital advisors based on artificial intelligence noticeably lighten the load of our service centres. Our customers benefit from shorter hold times. Or geo-location sensors and the use of tracking systems ensure a faster allocation of replacement parts for aircraft.;The ne level of digitalization will deal with the question of how to use new digital opportunities to increase the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers with products and services that are tailored to their needs. With over 100 million passengers per year, how can we use the increasing number of customer interactions and the resulting data streams to make even better decisions? The keyword here is big data. We can use customer analytics and artificial intelligence to deduce customer preferences and to personalize and optimize our guests travel e.;There is another level of digitalization with enormous potential: new market structures. It is strategically advisable for us to develop our own platform-based systems or to participate in such systems. Platform-based business models that operate, for the most part, without infrastructure of their own bundle access to customers and structure the content of the offers. There are a number of well-known e: UBER, for instance, is currently revolutionizing the ta industry around the world, and AirBnB is tapping the demand of the market for hotel stays. The point here is less to efficiently structure and control resources than to promote and direct outside interaction. For the Lufthansa Group and many of its subsidiaries, this will involve a profound transformation.;In our group, we are developing initiatives in every dimension of digitalization at the airlines and at the service companies. Digital innovation will ensure that we have a competitive advantage, in particular wherever we can combine new technologies with e knowledge and many years of practical e. The goal is to make our business models compatible with new ideas.;If we can recognize the potential of digitalization, appreciate data as an asset and develop digital strategies today, this will also reveal new perspectives for the future.;(3);(2);(1);Of marriage proposals and shitstorms;Tracking down aircraft;Pinterest is female;of;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;ID:;ID:; (All Fields Required) ;You must complete additional steps or remove assets to resume downloading.; (All Fields Required) ;Your Media Cart has been sent to:;You must enable cookies in your browser to use the Media Cart feature.; Thank you for getting in touch with us, well get back to you as soon as possible. ; Some items have been removed from your Media Cart because they are no longer available or e. ; '\n",
            "b'.;18-APR-2017;.;Martijn Karssemeijer, Senior First Officer on a Boeing 747, looks at the visualization of his flight route. There are dots everywhere between Tehran and Frankfurt. If they are white, then the air is calm. Green dots indicate minor vertical air movements, while yellow or orange dots mean turbulence.;Sometimes turbulence literally comes out of a clear blue sky. First, there is slight juddering and then a sudden loss of height and the Fasten seat belt signs light up. We still dont have comprehensive forecasts that are accurate and reliable enough, says 43-year-old Karssemeijer. Currently pilots are given a weather forecast during their briefing, showing flight legs of several hundred kilometers in length where it might or might not be bumpy. Thats not a great help to us, says A380 Copilot Oliver Matz.;But Lufthansa pilots may soon have more accurate information about the location and strength of turbulence. Model forecasts will show turbulence on the navigation map in the cockpit. The eddy dissipation rate (EDR) measurement method is used on the electronic flight bag (EFB) in the cockpit to check the forecast. This produces a trail of white, green, yellow and orange dots. The EDR identifies how the energy in the atmosphere is distributed, regardless of the size, weight and speed of the aircraft. When an aircraft passes through turbulence, the system automatically records the strength of the shock on a scale from zero (calm) to one (e turbulence).;In the future, aircraft will be able to send the figure and the coordinates via a server on the ground to other planes in real time. Pilots will be able to move to a different altitude or at least warn flight attendants and passengers in good time, according to Karssemeijer. This will also allow dispatchers to make their flight schedules more accurate.;Karssemeijer, who is not only a pilot but also a project manager at Lufthansa, was responsible for implementing the EDR measurement method on the EFB. We make use of a variety of avionics data and the different concepts of in-flight connectivity, e Matz. Together with Karssemeijer, Matz carried out successful tests of the new system on two flights to Frankfurt.;The results are currently being used to assess the quality of the model forecasts. This will lay the foundations for a system that predicts turbulence for the airlines in the Lufthansa Group. Both of the pilots are certain that this will make flights safer and more pleasant for both passengers and crews.;(4);Lufthansa promotes German-Chinese cultural e.5 million passengers flew with the Lufthansa Group Airlines in August;Star Alliance launches Connection Service at Chicago OHare;of;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;ID:;ID:; (All Fields Required) ;You must complete additional steps or remove assets to resume downloading.; (All Fields Required) ;Your Media Cart has been sent to:;You must enable cookies in your browser to use the Media Cart feature.; Thank you for getting in touch with us, well get back to you as soon as possible. ; Some items have been removed from your Media Cart because they are no longer available or e. ; '\n",

            "b'.;30-JAN-2017;The A350-900 is the Lufthansa fleets state-of-the-art newcomer. This aircraft is considered the most advanced and most environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft in the world. The possibilities offered by the on-board entertainment system on the A350-900 are likewise leading edge. For the first time, passengers will have the option of making a selection from the on-board program from home before setting off and adding their favorite items to a playlist.;To do this, all passengers need to do is load the \"Lufthansa Companion App\" onto their own tablet or mobile phone. The on-board program is available up to six weeks in advance. Once on board, passengers then synchronize their personal favorite playlist with the screen in front of the seat, and there is also the option to use the own mobile device as a second screen. During the flight, passengers can then choose something to watch from their favorites list, and at the same time call up flight information, go on social media websites via FlyNet, do a little online shopping in the WorldShop, or find out a few things about the destination they are heading for. The app is available now and can be downloaded from Google Play Store - find it by entering \"Lufthansa Companion App\" in the search field. The app will also soon be available in the Apple iTunes Store.;Lufthansa\\'s entertainment program alone will be enough to stop passengers from getting bored. There is currently a choice of 100 movies, 200 TV programs, an e audio program with lots of CDs, playlists and audio books, games to play, and a children\\'s section with lots of different films and music to choose from, plus information from the world of Lufthansa. Current news and sports reports from live TV channels can also be accessed via the seat screen or via the free FlyNet portal.;The flight information on offer also gives passengers an opportunity to try out a digital travel e in 3D. New interactive options make it possible to see the flight route in advance and to call up various different flight views.;The A350-900 also offers further improvements to comfort and convenience with larger screens for passengers in all classes. The user interface in the latest design provides passengers with a choice of ten different languages.;Lufthansa will be stationing the first ten Airbus A350-900 aircraft in Munich as of February 2017. The first destinations served will be Delhi and Boston. The aircraft can carry 293 passengers - 48 in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class.

            "b\".;22-APR-2016;Another chapter in the history of Munich Airport will begin on April 26, 2016: with the launch of the new satellite terminal Germany's first midfield terminal Europe's only five-star airport is again setting new standards for e service, passenger comfort and sustainability. The satellite terminal is also a continuation of the successful joint venture between Munich Airport and Lufthansa. As in Terminal 2, the partners have joined forces to design, build and finance the new passenger handling facility on a 60:40 basis. The Munich architectural firm Koch + Partner was selected for the design and general planning.;The new facility will give Munich Airport 27 new gate positions where passengers can board aircraft directly without bus transportation. With the new satellite facility, the capacity of Terminal 2, which is used by Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners, will be increased by 11 million to 36 million passengers per year. As one of the world's most advanced passenger facilities, the satellite terminal will offer passengers pleasant surroundings with a wide range of shopping and dining options in attractive and spacious areas flooded with natural light. Passengers will also have five new Lufthansa lounges to choose from.;The satellite has no direct landside transportation links. Check-in will take place in Terminal 2. Passengers will then undergo passport screening and hand baggage checks before boarding the airport's own underground transport system that will take them to the satellite terminal in barely a minute. Here they will e the same high standards of quality they have come to e in Terminal 2. Of course they will have free access to the airport-wide Wi-Fi network, and can plug their devices into USB and power outlets in the waiting areas.;Awaiting passengers in the satellite terminal is an entirely new dining and shopping e, with 15 retail areas, seven restaurants and cafes and three duty free zones in a spacious, 7,000 square meter setting. The architecture, the shopping options and the wide variety of foods and drinks available reflect the Bavarian lifestyle and Munich's unique character. The satellite also features plenty of services to meet the needs and desires of the modern traveller, including quiet areas with reclining chairs, play areas for children, changing tables in the men's and women's washrooms, and four showers. All services are situated at the center of the new building for quick and convenient access by customers. From here the five new Lufthansa lounges are just steps away. With an area of 4,000 square meters, this nearly doubles the total area of the Terminal 2 lounge facilities. The new concept features a roof terrace, panoramic windows and a bar overlooking the airport apron.;(19);EN;Opening of MUC Satellite;EN;Opening Event for MUC Satellite;DE;Satellitenerffnung-Gebude;DE;Satellitenerffnung-Event;Lufthansa promotes German-Chinese cultural e.5 million passengers flew with the Lufthansa Group Airlines in August;Star Alliance launches Connection Service at Chicago OHare;of;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;ID:;ID:; (All Fields Required) ;You must complete additional steps or remove assets to resume downloading.; (All Fields Required) ;Your Media Cart has been sent to:;You must enable cookies in your browser to use the Media Cart feature.; Thank you for getting in touch with us, well get back to you as soon as possible. ; Some items have been removed from your Media Cart because they are no longer available or e. ; \"\n",

The 70-year-old driver made it to the final in Gainesville and he lost in the semi-finals in Charlotte after qualifying on the pole, both times to David Barton. Watson faced Stephen Bell in the opening frame and handled him easily when Bell Camaro spun off the line. That set up a semi-final match with Barton and his quick COPO. just concentrated, I didn do anything different, said Watson. Barton had spun badly in the First round, but his opponent redlighted.

My confidence was like 100 percent, and I just cut the light and ran my race. Kevin [Skinner] had a little too much in the car and spun. There no drama, the car just goes, Watson said. had the wrong converter in Gainesville and the car was violent. It really responding to changes and we can tune in a smaller window. After racing in the with a 1964 Gala and a Mustang, Watson took a break to focus on business. He returned in the 1990s with one of the first modular-powered drag cars and ran mostly local Ford-based events. Watson took another hiatus from drag racing, but returned about three years ago when his son, Chuck Jr. and the team at Watson racing secretly built him a 2014 Cobra Jet. be honest with you, on my birthday in September my son and the employees built me a black 2014 CJ. I got a collection of about 70 cars, mostly cars and I parked the CJ in the collection and the ne spring I got my [NHRA] license and started getting active.

            "b\";One of the over-arching themes I noticed at the Forum, was how developers can make virtualization more attractive for users who are considering containers as a fundamental layer of abstraction. Developers are intrigued with the possibility of deploying infrastructure in minutes rather than weeks. Containers also allow developers to define the infrastructure needed for their applications and ensure that each time their application is deployed it gets the same resources no matter the environment. Containers do not provide the same level of isolation as virtual machines. A VM has an entire operating system to itself that believes its installed on its own (virtual) hardware. It must share resources with the other VMs running on the same host, but the hypervisor pro access to physical resources. A container has only the binaries and libraries defined as required available to it, and runs on the same (Linux) kernel as other containers. The kernel pro access to physical resources like it does any other user mode process. Cgroups and namespaces provides isolation. For environments where high security or guaranteed performance is required, this is not a sufficient level of isolation.;Speed of deployment is one of the main drivers for adoption of containers. Because of the light level of isolation, containers can be deployed very quickly. Rather than provisioning an entire virtual server and installing an operating system, when deploying a container we need only define the container parameters and download any libraries we might be missing. KVM developers want to help users enjoy the benefits of both technologies by making VM deployments as speedy as containers. That means we want to pre-empt as much as possible so a responsive Operating System is available as soon as possible after provisioning.;By far, the bulk of the conversation about KVM development in 2016/2017 was about improving I/O performance. As I mentioned, Im new to Red Hat but not new to virtualization. I find a lot of my conversations about virtualization with customers inevitably lead to a discussion of I/O performance. There are a few different tracks of development related to I/O performance. KVM-rt is the KVM Realtime work. Some notable sessions that addressed this topic include:;Security is a theme woven into the fabric of the KVM project.;A number of sessions throughout the 3-day forum were focused on where KVM is going. For a community driven project like KVM, the roadmap isnt just about features and bug fi, its also about how the community can work together better. How can we be more efficient communicating, reviewing and accepting patches?;The KVM developer community is very accepting. Perhaps a few folks reading will chuckle at that statement. Im sure submitting patches can be frustrating at times as with any large project. But in my short e interacting with folks, everyone was quick to share informationand were very open to e development concepts to a server guy.;The only accurate documentation in a project like KVM is the code. Ive since gone back to the C programming language, refreshing my development skills so I can better understand whats happening. When looking for details about the new developments in KVM, the best place to go to, is the code. The beautiful thing about KVM as a virtualization platform is that everything is out in the open.

            "b'I am a self-described fan of pop culture, so I (like many others) have been counting the days to the return of . Yesterday returned after a too-long hiatus, and so did one of my favorite characters the Xerox 914. It was a big deal (literally) when it first arrived, back in the first episode of season two: She right it was a big piece of technology at the start. As the world very first fully automated, plain-paper copier, it initially weighed a whopping 648 pounds. In this episode, the copier spent several days sitting in the middle of the office (and being curiously gawked at by the agency employees), before being relocated to copywriter Peggy office, much to her dismay especially when she walked in to find one of the ad men copying his face. Not surprisingly, Ned the Xerox repairman was not too happy about this misuse of the machinery (see above video). The Xerox 914 was more than just a piece of new technology for these ad e; it , making it significantly faster to duplicate documents (be it advertisements or otherwise) and making everyone office lives a whole lot easier. Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of Newsweek, even in her column in last week 60s-inspired special issue. When looking back on some of the things that made a splash in Newsweek 1960s coverage, she writes, office psychodramas in Men ran parallel with a serial melodrama in the news that covered with panache the dominance of that new tech phenomenon the Xerox machine. Printers and copiers have certainly gotten a lot lighter, faster and more multi-function since the debut of the Xerox 914, but Xerox still remains an important member of the office staff through offerings like managed print services (MPS). In fact, Xerox was just named the in a recent IDC report. We helped businesses save millions of dollars by offering the tools, support, security and processes to simplify the way work is done and uncover hidden print costs. I hope that I get to see more of the Xerox 914 this season maybe it will even help win a new account for my friends at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Thought you would find this interesting.

Actually, in many cases smart devices enhance sensory perception, safety, awareness and certainly communications. The Smart Mobility Era is here, and the they are a. While smartphones, tablets and similar mobile devices remain prevalent, a new generation of technologies are coming that will rock the boat in terms of how we live our lives and do our jobs. (Some are here already.) recognize the power and potential of mobility, and are in a fever to showcase demonstrative results. Jim Joyce Think Google Glasses, Wi-Fi watches, even wireless and sensor circuitry woven within our shirts and pants. Today, think of the Fitbit, Samsung GALAXY Gear, Sony SmartBand and recent chatter about smart contact lenses. someone who personally suffers from hearing loss, I have an app I can use to adjust sounds around me taking out background noise and allowing me to focus more specifically on certain conversations or sounds. The common denominator among these devices is data. For every phone, tablet or pair of glasses, there a steady flow of information, coming and going, that can be collected, analyzed and applied in numerous ways. Most of this information focuses on unstructured data such as video, graphs, photographs and documents. The push to consumerize such devices is proliferating. But equally powerful is the use of mobile devices wearables the workplace. They may be the ne-generation tool that helps you do your job. Such technologies are a core component for companies set upon advancing workplace agility ability to respond and act quickly, be nimble, proactive and more responsive. agility requires companies to invent and innovate so their entire companies can operate as a mobile enterprise. Xerox is working with several organizations to enable mobile, cloud, big data and analytics to work together in this way. Organizations recognize the power and potential of mobility, and are in a fever to showcase demonstrative results. Consider how wearables and mobility can transform classrooms, hospitals, manufacturing plants and especially services companies. Imagine working in a chemical plant wearing an intrinsically safe wristwatch-like device that monitors air quality in real time and sends immediate alerts prior to a crisis. Worse, if a disaster occurs, that same device becomes a voice-enabled avatar that leads you to the closest evacuation e. It can all be mind-blowing in technology terms, but the real heart of workplace agility is its focus on people frontline workers in a company who walk the sales floor, repair the air conditioners, or give medicines to patients. They are the ones who will define which companies are most successful and most agile. They are likely to be the pioneers of the newest wearables and related devices. It a new time. A new era. A new window of opportunity to race ahead of industry laggards. Customers win because they gain the benefit of frontline workers who work smarter and faster, and are fully informed, engaged and connected. Ultimately, you are the winner with an agile workplace, equipped workers and customers who keep coming back. can help companies improve their workplace agility.

            "b'I am 17 years old, going into my senior year of high school. That makes me among the oldest of Generation Z. Although typically, most 17 year olds don have two internships under their belt (not trying to be cocky), I feel that my attitude and outlook on work is fairly typical for most teens. the following few reasons, I think that Gen Z has the potential to be a tremendous workforce. Do you think Millennials are the kids? Think again. They grew up during the rise of the Internet; it became their second language. However, my generation is growing up in a time when the Internet and technology are central to our lives. We are natives of the Internet. This will only be advantageous in the workplace. Always being alert of my phone means I can respond to emails, te and phone calls immediately; communication is key. Z has the potential to be a tremendous workforce. Jordan Hiken, Xerox intern And with more technology comes more information and knowledge. Gen Z will be the most productive generation due to the immense amount of information available to them at the click of a button. Tasks will get done faster and more accurately. Social media will also play a huge role in the Gen Z workforce. We will take full advantage of all that social media has to offer and build tremendous relationships with customers. Growing up during a period of much uncertainty the 9/11attacks , the economic recession, and changing social norms Gen Z motives are not purely monetary. These society-altering events also left us a little bit insecure. Personal contentment and bettering the world are things that we look for in a job. reports that 76 percent of us want to turn our hobby into a full time job, and 60 percent want our jobs to impact the world. (Hopefully in a positive way.) Rather than working for others, we have an entrepreneurial spirit; as much as we want to better the world, we want to make some money along the way. I like to think that we are mature, self-directed, and resourceful. For GenZ, I see a very bright light at the end of the tunnel. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

            "b'Early in my career, I took a service call at an account that was new to me. Everything went well until the customer asked me how things were going. ! I replied. maybe I should have put my glasses on before I did that last adjustment on your copier. I then pulled holographic glasses with huge, 3D eyes out of my pocket, and put them on. The woman screamed at the top of her lungs and the entire office went silent, as they turned to see me red-faced and bug-eyed. If not for several women who found this hysterical, my Xerox career would have been brief. Whether you are moving into a new assignment, relocating for convenience, or simply taking on a new customer, a good first impression will start any new relationship off on the right foot. I spent 30 years servicing Xerox equipment in the field , had several reassignments, a relocation, and come in contact with countless new customers. First impressions are vitally important to me, and I learned that how you present yourself should not be taken lightly. Here are the top five things I learned about how to begin a lasting business relationship. For e customers, someone has already found out what not to say. Ask colleagues for any scoop they have on a customer likes and dislikes. For new customers, an Internet search will help you become familiar with the business environment you are walking into. we get so caught up in letting customers know what we have to offer that we miss out completely on what they want. Donald B. Stephens, senior customer service engineer for Xerox. When accepting a relocation to another country, this is a must. But don take it for granted if you are simply moving to another area of the same country. You will shoot yourself in the foot if you take the not going to act like these country bumpkins approach. Watch the people you work with and learn. You save yourself a lot of embarrassment and make better impressions. yourself is the advice you hear most when meeting new people, but for certain personality types, that can get you into trouble quickly. Certainly, you don want to be phony, but pouring on the can be overwhelming. I like to joke around with customers, and it has made for great relations, but first I have to earn the right. I made some of my biggest blunders by making wise-cracks before I understood the customer sense of humor. Your cell rings it the boss. You being sent to a customer who has hit the ceiling and is threatening to cancel. At the same time your spouse te you to say a water pipe has e over the baby crib. A bit e? Maybe, but you get the point. We all make promises that we intend to keep, but our busy, stressful lives often sidetrack us and keep us from following through. Customers understand this and are forgiving, but just like jesting, you have to earn the right to be forgiven. It human nature to doubt the sincerity of a stranger. Don cement that doubt by breaking early promises, even for simple matters. Sometimes we get so caught up in letting customers know what we have to offer that we miss out completely on what they want. A good listener asks open-ended questions that seek to gain understanding on how to serve a customer better, which is what will keep you in business and make a positive impression that will be hard to forget. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

            "b'The ability to take care of a customer has become a strong point of differentiation when done right. It is often the attribute that separates success from failure. Given the ease with which bad reviews can travel, 2015 will see many brands shifting into proactive mode e a helping hand before customers even ask for it. from WDS, A Xerox Company, innovators in customer care. The trends are fast-changing in customer care, with 2015 shaping up to be another transformative year. E at WDS have put together their in the ne 12 months. The headline notwithstanding, I present three trends from our report to whet your appetite. Each is accompanied by 90-second videos of Xerox researchers who share related insights from their work. I think you appreciate the insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation at your leisure. By the end of 2015, Forrester Research reports, 42 percent of the world population will own a smartphone. The ubiquitous device increasingly defines how we communicate, how we travel, how we shop and how we engage with brands. If a customer wants to communicate with a brand, it increasingly likely to be through a mobile device. E: According to the Wall Street Journal, Hilton Worldwide is investing $550 million to optimize their mobile customer e, from start to finish. During 2014, we also saw Starbucks and Citibank start using mobile e to promote customer loyalty. The challenge for companies will be how to integrate mobile, and all it represents, into a larger ecosystem of contact methodologies. Organizations will be e to the conte of a conversation that may have spread out across various channels over days, weeks or even months. When engaging a brand for support, today customers have an abundance of choices. But not all channels are created equally. You have a 90 percent chance of a successful resolution when contacting a call center; over social channels or Web services, the probability drops to 70 percent. The reason is quite simple: Customers often can find the answer to their problems and also miss out on the benefits of the two-way nature of a conversation. Machine learning and natural language processing is reinventing our view of self-service and driving new levels of success. A new generation of virtual agents will emerge this year that can learn from terabytes of data to provide conte, relevant responses instantly and with the same accuracy as a live agent in a call center. Great customer care is defined by the ability to provide an e that is e right for each unique customer. But this can be a tall order, particularly for medium-to-large companies. There are just too many people to meet. But brands can now lean on smart machines to get better acquainted with their customers, without the limitations of scale. Capable of collecting huge volumes of data and processing this to surface valuable and timely customer insights, at an individual level, brands will be better able to add that personal touch. Harnessing both big and small data processing, tomorrow smart customer care technology will listen to big data to spot trends and prioritize appropriate action. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

            "b'Technical Services has seen more than its share of changes in the past decade. We have seen new processes in everything from the parts in our vehicles to the way we approach our service calls each day. To say this has been a challenge is an understatement. Don Stephens is a senior customer service engineer in his 30th year with Xerox. When he isn repairing high-volume printers, Don is a blogger, an author and a freelance writer. Technicians are resistant to change, but not for the reasons you might think. Here are three reasons why I believe that field service reps react to change less than favorably at times. In order to be successful in field service, we must develop good work habits. We are on our own 99 percent of the time, and the temptation to goof off weeds out those who can work on their own in the first year. New processes mean changing tried and true habits that we have come to rely on. Sometimes it can be like reinventing the wheel by adding square edges or at least it feels that way. We want to see the corporation succeed, we really do, but when we hear, is the direction the company is heading period we tend to bristle and dig in our heels. Because A leads to B, which in turn leads to C in our minds, we to be given the whole picture. Most of the time this is provided, but occasionally we are left to scratch our heads and wonder where we are headed as a company. (Oh and we rarely have time to sort through our email for the one that has e it in great detail. If our manager hasn gone over it, then we are still dragging our feet.) Tech reps: Creatures of habit, practical, and suspicious. Here why. http:/ctt.ec/NcgdQ+ #FieldService pic.twitter.com/D7wvYsTdRT I was told by a team member my first week on the job that, you don like something about the company, then wait six months it will be gone by then. Most of the service force has 20-plus years. Having seen many programs come and go, (some of which only lasted a brief time for good reasons) we are understandably hesitant when ne big revolution comes along. We sit back and watch to see if it is going to be a flash in the pan or something that is here to stay. When we are satisfied that the change is permanent, we jump on board and try to enjoy the ride. Occasionally our skeptical side rears up with a new process and we dig in our heels; even if it makes perfect sense and is good for the company and our jobs. You might have to pull on the reins a bit. But please pull gently we are a sensitive lot too. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

So what can enterprise businesses learn from one of the most creative brands in the world? I had the pleasure of sitting down with Florent Bayle-Labour, senior director of brand management and synergy at , to discuss the customer e. What can your brand learn from Cirque du Soleil? http:/ctt.ec/cr_aZ+ pic.twitter.com/kVtGGttFoV Bayle-Labour gave me a sneak peek into the company unique way of thinking and operating. He shared how uses organic and organized customer feedback to drive the audience e. He also discussed how plans to bigger with their brand. Here are two lessons Bayle-Labour taught me at simple@work 2015 in London. To improve the customer e, businesses must be better listeners than ever. Bayle-Labour e, are two types of feedback: the organic and the organized. The organic is the live feedback you get every night. It is the emotion customers feel when interacting with your brand. In entertainment, this is easily measured by applause. organizations need to learn how to capture and then focus on how they are making their customers feel. that feeling needs to become consistent. Organized feedback is very common and includes customer surveys, social reviews and marketing research. This data-driven approach allows to make strategic decisions about their shows and other industry initiatives. The key here is the balance between emotion and numbers. Businesses that strike that balance can transform an industry. Bayle-Labour believes it is very important to apply your creative strategy to transform your industry continuously. In 1984, redefined circus. Today, they are taking that same sweeping approach to nightclubs and children television, among other sectors. I asked him how plans to scale their e into new cities and shows. not so much a question of scaling the e, but more a question of what is coming ne in entertainment, said Bayle-Labour. Businesses need to look at their industry and figure out how they can be the disruptors. Bayle-Labour shared that is continuously looking to transform. He said enterprises should ask, can you transform what already e? No matter your industry, your brand is the most important element of your business. brand, says marketing evangelist Seth Godin, the set of e, promises, memories, stories, and relationships, taken together, account for a consumer decision to choose one product or service or another. Xerox is an official sponsor of Learn more at . Bayle-Labour taught me that we must continue to evolve. The e your customers have with your brand is instrumental to success. Listen to your customers. Notice how they feel when they interact with your brand. Use data and organized feedback to steer the e you create for them. And most importantly, never settle. Your industry is always evolving.

            "b'This is it. Less than 12 days to check off those holiday wish lists, and the retail workforce is feeling the crunch. Luckily, the reinforcements have arrived! The seasonal workforce kicked in when college students headed home to earn some e cash as associates at their favorite stores. But how do retailers get these temporary workers who have been in a classroom studying history, engineering or broadcast journalism for the past few months up to speed on customer requirements and able to answer questions? do retailers assure their reinforcements offer good information, and accurately represent the retail brand at the point of need in the store With the holiday rush ratcheting up, these workers don have the days or weeks for the training most full time associates get. Foregoing traditional classroom training sessions for technology-enabled informal learning will actually help these modern learners retain more, and be more versatile with the application of their knowledge. They will be more motivated, engaged, and ultimately more effective if you teach them in-store, with content they can access in a self-taught, self-constructed way. 4 ways #retailers get seasonal employees up to speed quickly. #BlackFriday http:/ctt.ec/4K9+ Here are four tips for turning seasonal help in to shopping sales success: Digestible content should be accessible at the point of need via tablets, mobile apps, or in-store kiosks. should be able to alternate between short practices and focused topics quickly and easily, but not through multi-tasking. This short-sequence construct allows learners to identify their own gaps quickly and fill them accordingly. The customer comes to the store for an e you want your associate focused on providing that e, versus simply making the sale. The content you provide on specific products, services or features, has to be set into the conte of the desired e. The associate must be able to find it, understand it and share it, without losing track of the e in in less than four minutes in order to assure the positive customer e remains intact. Just as your associates have to adapt to customer behaviors, your learning infrastructure must be adaptable to support your associates. Content should be managed from a single source and updated based on factors like usage, buyer reaction, sales or net promoter scores. While modern learners do best with a hands-on, self-directed learning environment, they also need the ability to access a lifeline when the situations demands it. This can play out in several ways they can use other in-store e for assistance, engage an e or a community of e quickly via a mobile device. They may also take advantage of a regional coaching model where e drop by regularly to reinforce brand e, and assist with advanced questions or sales situations. The most successful retailers mobilize temporary staff to be ambassadors for their brand making it an e, rather than a sale. You want customers to walk away with a simple thought: was really easy or were great. In-store learning that is joined to technology, and well-designed content helps these temporary ambassadors deliver the e that shoppers e. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

            "b' office isn necessarily a physical location anymore. Business & Workplace Author, Speaker and Consultant Yesterday I traveled to the Gil Hatch Center for Customer Innovation in Rochester, N.Y., to talk with my partner and visiting press and analysts about the future of work and office technology. Given that the office isn a physical location anymore, both software and hardware must be configured to be used effectively and efficiently by a growing virtual, mobile and contract workforce. Whether you are an enterprise or an SMB, here are the must-haves for your technology. Technology must be accessible anytime, anywhere, by both full-time and contract workers. Mobile phones must be able to seamlessly communicate with other devices via the Internet of Things as well as any onsite infrastructures and systems, and users want to automate complex processes with a single touch or action. And, all of this must be done with minimal intervention from IT as these professionals can only assist so many people at once. In 2016, fle is king, meaning that the days of the majority of your employees working together in the same location are likely numbered. But technology must facilitate virtual work in which it just as easy and productive to engage with your colleague in Japan as it is with the one in the cubicle ne door. Technology must be agile, with the ability to support new collaboration apps being developed on the consumer side or via in-house citizen development. 5 must-haves for your technology, whether you are enterprise or SMB. via @alevit http:/ctt.ec/f6OpJ+ #IT #OfficeTech When it comes to intellectual property residing in the cloud, security remains the biggest concern. Organizations want their data stored in a central location and accessible by everyone who needs it, but documents must be managed in a way that is controllable and protects them from internal and e threats and breeches. Employees have variable needs and every individual has his or her own way of doing things, so mandating a certain process for using technology is a surefire way to hinder adoption. Tomorrow office systems must be personalized so that whether you prefer to print via mobile or manual methods or scan via email or QR codes, you covered. Despite the obviously increasing sophistication of office technology demands, according to IDC, 40 percent of smartphone users and 35 percent of tablet users don even know how to print from their device. So, as an e of new office technologies that address these demands while also simplifying solutions for the individual, Xerox has just released the 14 . In order to accommodate a diverse mobile workforce, the MFPs are designed with an intuitive user display with ready-to-use MFP applications right on the interface. In particular, the Mobile Link app lets users create one-touch, automated workflows on their mobile devices to remotely control a Xerox MFP and transmit documents to fax, email and cloud-hosted services like Box, Dropbox and Google Drive. And, perhaps most importantly, the new MFPs have secure print and scan encryption so companies can ensure that documents remain confidential.

The more people you meet, the more meaningful relationships you cultivate. I joined the , an affinity group for the ne generation of leaders at Xerox. This group matched me (and other interns) with Xerox employees who have one to 10 years of e, and who work outside our departments. My mentor, Kate, knows e who to send me to within Xerox when I have questions about my career or goals that she can answer. She has been e supportive with my don know what I want yet, but I think I have a path and I see where it goes mentality. (That part of my e mantra.), Always keep in touch. This goes for the person who works three cubicles away from you as much as the CTO. It all good and well to have formal meetings and Q and A sessions, but really getting to know someone on a personal level can make all the difference in how you remembered. As a result of these conversations, I been asked to make designs for a tradeshow, write this article, and have one-on-one printing sessions where I set up my files for print. My manager calls these to my time because they enrich my summer e. I never would have had these opportunities if I hadn stuck my neck out and said , this is really cool. Can I learn more? Can I help with this? Me and Cameron at the intern program annual Redwings Game for interns and managers. You an intern, not a mind reader if you don know what your goal on a project should be, talk with your manager or a coworker about your concerns. You e to come in every day with questions, daily goals, and possibly an elevator speech about it all. Be certain that your goals, whenever you figure them out, are authentically yours. You should have passion or curiosity driving everything you want to achieve. People who work at Xerox will respect your honesty, whether or not you know e what e you are seeking. If you are honest, open, and authentic about these things, then you go further in your time here. Get out of your comfort zone.

A valuable customer resource center should include industry relevant articles, case studies and industry reports that illustrate new technologies and tools and report the results of campaigns that used those tools.

But while everyone welcomes spring and summer, the sun brings its own challenges that are just as formidable as snow and wind chill factors. That\\'s why a little preventive maintenance now can help avoid service disruptions later this summer, when customers need it. \"The key to a pleasant summer is a pre-season tune-up,\" said Georgeann Georges, vice president/general manager of Sears In-Home Product Repair Services. \"In the summer, a home\\'s cooling system is critical for a family\\'s comfort and safety. Sears recommends homeowners take time now to ensure their cooling systems are functioning properly before the season begins.\" To ensure their homes remain a cool oasis against the elements, Sears is offering two specials. The first gives homeowners a chance to save more than over 50 percent off the regular price on a pre-season cooling system tune-up from now until May 15(1). The second offers zero percent financing until April 2004 on select new Kenmore or Carrier systems or 10 percent off. This offer ends April 26, 2003(2). Customers can call 1-800-4-MY-HOME or visit www.sears.com for full details on offers, zero percent financing or to schedule an in-home service appointment or request a free in-home estimate with a cooling specialist for a new or replacement system.

Sears has more than 10,000 in-home service technicians skilled at repairing every ajor brand of cooling systems, no matter where they were purchased.

            "b'Christophe Legras, Technology Showroom Engineer at , had a busy time at , demonstrating some very clever ways to speed up business processes. We caught up with Christophe after the event. It an increasingly big issue for our customers. Technology has made so many things so much faster, it really highlights the inefficiencies of processes that are still very manual. Inefficiency is costly, so there a real drive to streamline and accelerate these processes by automating manual steps as far as possible and eliminating the need to move physical paper around. We been working on different aspects of for years; what we showed at IT is how it all comes together. We integrated a variety of information management technologies, including , information categorisation technologies, and workflow and platforms. Together these let us digitise information, make it accessible from anywhere, rapidly and reliably identify specific information, and automatically route it where it needs to go. We are; we combining certain techniques to categorise unstructured data more quickly and reliably than other methods. Then we put these capabilities in the hands of knowledge workers through . One of the use cases we demonstrated at IT is e-discovery. Legal teams often have very little time to comb through millions of electronic files to find the ones relevant to a case or audit. The nature of legal relevance makes it very difficult to narrow the field just with keyword searches. Many e-discovery tools include to help: this groups documents by how similar they are to one another, based purely on statistical analysis of the content, not any predefined criteria or search terms. It a powerful tool, but we taken it a step further to create a solution that we call CategoriX. This is a statistical categorisation technology that adds a machine learning capability. Using CategoriX, we take a sample of the total volume of files and have legal reviewers categorise them as relevant or not. The algorithms from this e categorisation and create an appropriate statistical model. With only a small amount of the algorithm can process the vast majority of the content e quickly and accurately. we helped a customer respond to a regulatory subpoena in 54 days, with 92.3% precision and 99.8% recall. We used just 10 of the company attorneys; they would have needed 68 additional attorneys to achieve the same results without the categorisation technology. It used by Xerox managed services such as for e-discovery, and Xerox Document Transaction Processing Services. So customers of those services benefit from these capabilities. Wherever you can reliably isolate relevant files through keyword searches or through their structure, you got a potential use case. For e, we use it to analyse whether contracts are complying with regulatory requirements, or for narrowing down thousands of job applicants. It still early days for this technology so we actively e potential use cases with customers. They can contact me at and I try to answer their questions or direct them to someone who can.

To be sure, the push toward greater organizational adoption of BYOD (bring your own device) policies and procedures is a major component of most comprehensive mobile-technology implementation strategies. Which is why the article, , courtesy of the on IT series on Spiceworks.com, is particularly timely. The author is an IT manager who was tasked with building-out his agency BYOD infrastructure. In the Spiceworks article he provides a helpful overview of his thought process, and gives specific advice for how to work with e IT systems to develop a suitable BYOD solution. He also touches on the differences between getting the technology right and ensuring proper end-user adoption and compliance. From the piece: took one weekend, and only about 10 hours total, to reconfigure everything to support BYOD access. The policies took longer they always do because we needed to educate people on what it means to access corporate resources in a healthcare environment. We had to deal with apps that didn work particularly well in 4-inch doses ( E on your phone is still the worst joke ever told). We had to deal with increased traffic patterns. We had to deal with personal laptops riddled with malware (blocking them from access is easy e why is harder). We had to e that we reserved the right to fully wipe any personal device used to access company data or apps if it ever goes missing. The author then lists three key areas of focus, based on his e, for others to consider when undertaking a similar BYOD rollout: For further elaboration on those three points, and to read more about the author e, I encourage you to read the article in its entirety.

            "b'From the tens of thousands of applications that institutions receive each year, to the vast number of student records they must maintain for past and present students, universities are responsible for a massive amount of documents. Despite the overwhelming volume of documents across all university departments, many institutions have yet to make the transition away from manual, paper-based processes that ultimately increase costs and decrease productivity. These document-intensive processes that dominate universities across the country stand in stark contrast to the increasingly fast-paced, digital world in which students live. College students have unlimited access to information at their fingertips and they e the same speed of accessibility to their educational records. With that said, universities across the country are embarking on digital transformation to keep up with the demands of their student body. Xerox is addressing this challenge with the release of seven new Xerox workflow solutions for higher education that transform repetitive, error-prone and tedious tasks into highly accurate and automated processes that save time and money. The value of these seven workflow solutions for higher education lies not only in the proven time and cost savings, but also in the increased student satisfaction and improved student e they create campus-wide.

Research from says that US companies lose an estimated $41 billion every year after a bad customer e. Additionally, almost half of US consumers will take their business elsewhere after e less than adequate customer service. Regardless of industry, consumers e their interactions with brands to be painless, and if they not, they won hesitate to move on. This is especially the case with the millennial generation who generally have a much higher e for immediate results. E customer service is a must, so what is holding companies back?

Paper-based processes are manual and time-intensive, leaving less time to engage and grow e customers. As companies begin to optimize and improve their customer service, the best place to start is by digitizing and streamlining all forms of customer communications.

            "b' The most secure communication layer (SSL/TLS) on WWW was torn apart by the security researchers and we figured out that most of what we were using was not as secure as it sounded. TLS 1.1 and 1.2 became the need of the hour and NetScaler quickly responded back by implementing the support in MPX appliances. Now, NetScaler MPX-FIPS platform also becomes stronger with support of TLS 1.1/1.2 protocol. MPX-FIPS platforms are used in sensitive deployments where data security is critical and all such deployments can avail the new support now.;When I saw the 2014 biopic ;which is set in World War II, I was astonished to see how Alan Turing successfully broke the super strong ciphers created by the Enigma machine, which the Nazis used to secure their wireless messages. His efforts were helpful in saving thousands of lives around the world.;In the modern conte, sensitive data, from credit card numbers to patient health information to social networking details, need protection when transmitted across an insecure network. Data with defence and federal agencies are considered even more sensitive and thus they need stronger cryptographic infrastructure. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mandates such agencies to comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) to meet their strict security requirements.;The FIPS Publication 140-2 is a U.S. government computer security standard used to accredit cryptographic modules. To coordinate the requirements and standards for cryptography modules including both hardware and software, the NIST issued the FIPS 140 Publication Series.;Citrix NetScaler comes in FIPS variant as well which is in compliance with FIPS 140-2 level 2. It provides organizations with additional security by protecting unauthorized access to cryptographic keys, which if misappropriated could result in a data security breach.;NetScaler FIPS appliance are available in four form factors with Pay-as-You-Grow model. These are MPX 9700/10500/12500/15500.;SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 both have vulnerabilities in their implementation. These vulnerabilities were e by various attacks like POODLE and BEAST. SSL 3.0 is becoming obsolete now and TLS 1.0 is not secure enough considering the advancement in processing and computing power. Large ciphers can also be broken now which were practically impossible to do earlier.;The security issues with SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 are addressed by TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. It is recommended by NIST that government servers and clients should move to TLS 1.1 and 1.2.;Government is taking proactive steps in terms of security of data and NIST has asked the federal agencies to move to TLS 1.2 before Oct 1 2015.;NetScaler FIPS appliances start supporting TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols from 10.5.e MR build 55.8007.e, released in Q2 2015. This will result in the product to comply with the NIST mandate for federal agencies to use TLS 1.2 from October 2015 and enables NetScaler to be successfully deployed in government organizations. Already deployed NetScaler FIPS appliances shall be upgraded to this build or later to support TLS 1.2 and continue its glorious run in the government sector.;As always NetScaler evolves itself and keeps its customers in a win-win situation.

            "b' Using these trends, Ive created a series of SLG Case Studies that looks at what agencies are currently accomplishing with Citrix, with the ultimate goal of allowing other government agencies to use these e as a template for how they can take a similar approach in solving their current challenges.;For a look at the other case studies, please visit ;.;When speaking with Department of Corrections agencies, the most common use case they are looking to address is delivery of specific applications to prisons throughout the state. While I am no e in the regulations that surround this, there is a requirement to provide inmates access to legal documents and educational classes. As these inmates do not have their own laptops (imagine that BYOD policy), DOC agencies set up computer labs and classrooms with devices for their use where they can access resources such as law libraries and GED courses.;The scenario I described above is a common scenario Ive seen with several states, and is the perfect use case for virtualization of applications such as the electronic law library from Le and Pearson VUE for GED testing. Using Citrix XenApp, these apps can be delivered to thin clients in prisons computer labs/classrooms across the state. Thin clients are a great fit here because they are low cost and easy to replace if (or when?) broken.;Prior to taking this approach, one specific DOC agency I work with had over 30 decentralized and individually ran computer labs in prisons across the state. Each prison managed their own law library with hardbound books that needed to be updated on an annual basis. After the decision was made to centralize all prison-related IT systems, they chose to implement Citrix XenApp and were able to centrally manage and deliver a standardized set of applications to all 30+ computer labs across the state. Initial cost savings were in e of $200k per year for the law libraries alone.;Its important to note that these Citrix sessions can be completely locked down via Citrix and Microsoft policies to prevent inmates from breaking out of the session and communicating with the outside world. On the Citrix side of the house, this is done via our Desktop Lock policy, which runs the application or desktop session in full-screen mode and prevents users from accessing other resources on that device (which are already minimized through the use of a thin client). Policies can be applied to block access to search tools, command prompt, registry settings, etc. which could be used in an attempt to hack out of the session.;Feel free to contact me or leave a comment below if you have any questions.

            "b'In the weeks followingCitrix Synergy 2017, Ive been letting some thoughts coalesce in my head. Yes, gentle reader, Ive been thinking a lot. And if you have read my other blog posts, you know my long-term rumination can sometimes bea dangerous prospect. But I digress.;My thinkingis this: in spite of the emergence of cloud-based deployments,;deployments of Citrix software arestill a relevant and useful means of delivering applications and desktops to users.;Now, I love going to Citrix Synergy its one of my favorite industry events. This year marked my tenth time attending;Ive been quoted many times as saying thatSynergy is absolutelyworth my time (and its worth yours, too): training, networking, product updates, and generally geeking out with everyone that attends. Trust me, if there was time to interact with all of you, I would do e that. Everyone has a unique story and everyone has great e and insight into the thing that is Citrix.;Hearing first hand, too, about Citrix announcements and product updates is always e, too. This year was no different. The keynotes were chock full of enticing and scintillating announcements (one the most e takeawaysfrom the keynoteswas the aboutCitrix managed security services, anoffering thatshould be raised up and shouted from the mountaintops).;Do you see the elephant?;Avert your gaze maybe the itwill go away. Is it gone? Nope, still there. But wait! Thatelephant has something tattooed on its side; what does itsay? ON-PREMISES! Oh, of course, how could we havemissed that?! On-prem deployments werent talked about much during the Synergy keynotes and demos, and I absolutely get it. Cloud is the future; we all know this to be true. However, while many businesses are now moving to the cloud, its very important to rememberthat many are not; they are simply not ready, and thats okay;Ive noted before that Im an independent consultant. In talking with my peers, weve noticed a downturn in consulting and were not sure why. I spoke with others at Synergy and the issue soon became clear. I heard the following from MANY attendees, Cloud is great, and we know we have to go there, but were not just not ready; are there still options for us? Im really hoping some of the session feedback reflects that, because thats an e important point.;Citrix is still supporting on-premises deploymentsandwill be for a very longtime to come. Cloud is cool, but dont think that your local deployment is irrelevant. Its working for you, please continue. Citrix has such wonderful things now like the Long Term Service Release (LTSR) of all of its products. If you prefer newer features, then the Current Release (CR) branches are for you. If you need help, your friendly local Citrix consultants (hint, hint) are there for you.;Upgrade that old environment to the newer code and e the best that Citrix has to offer.

            "b'Securing your network has never been more critical than it is now, and meeting security compliance can be challenging. With a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant Citrix NetScaler SDX, you can achieve security compliance and easily deploy ADC instances to meet your performance requirements. Whether you are a service provider hosting ADC instances for clients, or securing your businesses network, the NetScaler FIPS SDX makes your deployment secure, easy, and scalable to meet demands.;For the administrator, deploying the NetScaler FIPS SDX may appear to be a challenge in itself but I can assure you that it is not as difficult as it seems. Once you take a look at the underlying components of the FIPS SDX appliance, the process becomes a bit clearer. The purpose of this article is to highlight the architecture of the FIPS SDX and provide a step by step setup guide of the FIPS HSM and deployment of a NetScaler HA pair that is FIPS enabled.;An SDX is built on top of the XenServer hypervisor and utilizes a service VM (SVM) instance for overall management. Using this SVM, you can deploy, manage, and monitor NetScaler instances. The difference with the FIPS-compliant SDX is the addition of the Cavium Hardware Security Module (HSM). This is often referred to as the FIPS card or module and is where all private PKI keys are stored. The HSM is also where all SSL transactions are performed on a FIPS- enabled instance. The SDX also contains an SSL card that is used for non-FIPS processes and can be used in a hybrid mode to meet even higher processing demands. An important item to note is that every instance you deploy does not need to be FIPS enabled. This can be useful if you are hosting multiple tenants or just want to separate workloads you can have both types of instances on the same appliance.;This document reviews the steps required to configure the NetScaler SDX FIPS appliance, starting with the out of box initial configuration of the SDX and hardware security module (HSM) initialization. Sections detailing instance setup include the initial instance creation as well as a secondary instance for a high availability (HA) pair setup.

The last few days have been something else.;Shell was ready. We knew Harvey was coming in, we could see some of our facilities were in its path (both onshore and offshore) and we put our plans into action: evacuating rigs, closing down refining and chemical operations, tying down equipment, protecting instruments, releasing staff to their homes to prepare, working out product supply plans with customers.;Then it hit. It came in fast. And, as CEO, I very quickly realised the situation was turning into something far more profound than I could have ever e.;Like most of you, I watched the footage on the television news and saw how Te were suffering. And it was with those images in my mind that I began to hear of, and marvel at, the e things that were being done by Shell staff on the ground.;People with their lives being turned upside down, with their possessions and property ruined and with the elements opposing them at every turn, were still doing their jobs, ensuring safety and helping their colleagues. The professionalism I have already heard about - and I am sure I have heard about only a tiny fraction of it - is humbling.;At Shell\\'s refining and chemicals facility southeast of Houston, Deer Park, hundreds of employees and contractors stayed at the site and rode out the storm there. to ensure safety, to assess damage, mitigate the impact and plan for recovery.;Staff from;also loaned some portable six inch pumps from the facility to a nearby neighbourhood that was about to be flooded. The mayor later said they had saved several hundred homes.;In the parts of our business that work to ensure customers get the products they rely on, many employees headed out in advance of the storm to remote operating centres where they could ensure those products kept moving.;In the community, Shell staff have helped out so many in need that people are flagging down anybody wearing the company pecten symbol to say \"thank you\".;These are the same staff who were worried that they wouldn\\'t have enough food to last until the flooding fell back. filling up their baths with water in fear of their supply becoming contaminated. printing off basic human survival checklists and advice to be ready for the very worst. trying to stay in contact with family and friends.;One Shell employee had six feet of water in her house. She realised there was nothing she could do. so she abandoned her home and took her husband and children to assist the Shell crisis team that had set up in another city.;And even now, with the sun coming back out and freeways beginning to emerge again from the water, the challenges keep on coming. and the professionalism in the face of those challenges keeps on coming.;The resilience that has been on show in Te has also been present 9,000 miles away in Mumbai, where floods have also hit and where Shell staff have also kept on going despite everything.;Shell planned for corporate resilience. but not the depths of human resilience we have witnessed: the courage, the grit and the determination.;I have never been more proud of the company that I work for than today. I have never been more impressed by those I work with than now, or felt more honoured to call them my colleagues. What they have done stands alongside some of the brightest moments in 105 years of Shell history in the US.;We will support those staff in all possible ways.

            "b' By Denise Breyley, May 3, 2012 | As the Pacific Northwest Local Forager, discovering new products and producers is certainly fun and a huge part of my job. But sometimes it even more fun to -discover an old favorite. isn just a classic local product. It a local and national treasure, too. Fran Bigelow opened her original Seattle store, Fran Patisserie & Chocolate Specialties, in 1982, focusing on freshly baked pastries and cakes. Her move toward confections began gradually; if you were lucky enough to be one of the early customers, you were often treated to a free chocolate truffle while waiting in line to purchase baked goods. Yum! Today, Fran Chocolates are known and loved far beyond the Pacific Northwest. She been featured on the Food Network and in newspapers around the country. When President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail four years ago, he discovered her legendary Smoked Salt Caramels and went bonkers for them. Now, special visitors to the White House receive a box of the salted caramels stamped with the Presidential Seal as a parting gift half in milk chocolate (The President favorite) and half in dark chocolate (First Lady Michelle preference). And of course, you can find Fran Chocolates in Whole Foods Market stores throughout the US. Since Fran marks 30 years of producing one-of-a-kind sweets on June 1 of this year, I took a tour of their production kitchens with CEO Andrina Bigelow, Fran daughter, to learn just what makes them so special. Hue (shown here) has been part of Fran for 19 years, and in the early years it was just Fran and Hue tying the ribbons on each box. Today Hue is the supervisor of packing and is still giving each box of chocolates that special touch. The quality of the product on the inside is matched by the presentation. I found the secret to Fran success can be boiled down to the highest quality ingredients; unwavering attention to detail with a focus on taste; and hiring and nurturing a talented team. I could see these principles demonstrated everywhere I looked on my tour, and it no surprise to me that they been going strong for as long as they have. Here to 30 more years!

Traditionally prepared by cooking Basmati rice with succulent chunks of chicken, cashews and raisins infused with an unmistakable blend of enticing spices, aromas and flavors, including a pinch of saffron salt.
